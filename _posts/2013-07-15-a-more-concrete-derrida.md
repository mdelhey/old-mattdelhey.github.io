title: 'A (More) Concrete Derrida'
date:  2013-07-15

I feel that Derrida gets a bad reputation as overly unapproachable among analytically-bent philosophy students that I've talked to. For various reason, his texts are often critiqued as being unnecessarily obtuse, perhaps, they say, to cover up the fact that he's not saying much at all. I don't want to say that this isn't true, but as I finish up my reading of "The Gift of Death" I've come across various passages that have Derrida talking in a very concrete, vivid and pragmatic manner. 

In fact, these cases when Derrida takes his arguments to some of their specific instantiations end up being some of my favorite moments in his book. But after re-reading what I've written here, perhaps it's not as concrete as I'd thought and so instead a _more_ concrete Derrida. Here's what I'm talking about:

> "In terms of the moral of morality, let us here insist upon what is too often forgotten
> by the moralizing moralists and good consciences who preach to us with assurance every 
> morning and every week, in newspapers and magazines, on the radio and on television, 
> about the sense of ethical or political responsibility. Philosophers who don't write 
> ethics are failing in their duty, one often hears, and the first duty of the philosopher 
> is to think about ethics, to add a chapter on ethics to each of his or her books and, 
> in order to do that, to come back to Kant as often as possible. What the knights 
> of good conscience don't realize, is that "the sacrifice of Isaac" illustrates--if 
> that is the word in the case of such a nocturnal mystery--the most common and everyday 
> experience of responsibility. The story is no doubt monstrous, outrageous, 
> barely conceivable: a father is ready to put to death his beloved son, his irreplaceable 
> loved one, and that because the Other, the great Other asks him or orders him without 
> giving the slightest explanation. 

Here Derrida is speaking right after his conclusion asserting the connection between secrecy and responsibility as demonstrated in the Christian story of Isaac. He demonstrates that this isn't an esoteric point by pointing out its inherent contradiction to the popular 'moralists'. Those who are seemingly always calling for this or that kind of responsibility are perhaps in opposition to that which makes absolute responsibility possible all together, namely secrecy. And it's not a theoretical dilemma. Derrida is saying that our everyday experience of responsibility doesn't match up with 'their' universalizing account of responsibility. If the moralists are to be believed, I think, then we are supposedly bound ('responsible') to a vast array of people, jobs, countries, animals, things... But in everyday experience we are also bound to those things which are completely personal like family, faith, ourselves. "I cannot respond to the call, the request, the obligation, or even the love of another without sacrificing the other other, the other others... every one else is completely or wholly other." So to heed the call of the moralists is to necessarily make a sacrifice. The expense is towards the important instantiations in our lives, which are ironically enough  our most potent sources of responsibility.

Continuing the issue of the wholly other (every other):


>"Whether I want to or not, I can never justify the fact that I prefer or sacrifice
> any one (any other) to the other. I will always be secretive, held to secrecy in respect of this,
> for I have nothing to say about it. What binds me to singularities, to this one or that one,
> male or female, rather than that one or this one, remains finally unjustifiable (this is
> Abraham's hyper-ethical sacrifice), as unjustifiable as the infinite sacrifice I make at each 
> moment. These singularities represent others, a wholly other form of alterity: one other or 
> some other persons, but also places, animals, languages. How would you ever justify the fact 
> that you sacrifice all the cats in the world to the cat that you feed at home every morning
> for years, whereas other cats die of hunger at every instant? Not to mention other people? 
> How would you justify your presence here speaking one particular language, rather than there
> speaking to others in another language? And yet we also do our duty by behaving thus. 
> There is no language, no reason, no generality or mediation to justify this ultimate 
> responsibility which leads me to absolute sacrifice."


I love the line here about cats. I don't think this is a new thought regarding pets, but it's well formulated. How do I justify picking one dog from the pet store over any of the others available? What about of all the dogs available in the world? All animals together? But the love I have for my dog isn't bunk, it's as real, important, and normative as anything else in my life. I think this is what Derrida is trying to say, that we can't justify these important aspects of our lives in terms of absolute responsibility (e.g. in the fashion of the moralists). Paradoxically, a fully rationalized or public account of responsibility cannot meet the call of responsibility. And so I suppose this is what Derrida means when he goes on and on about absolute sacrifice, that it is the absolute sacrifice of such an account of responsibility, of generalizable singularity (ethics) in this sense.
