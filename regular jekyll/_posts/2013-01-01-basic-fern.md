In this short post I'm going to demonstrate how to use <code>Scipy</code> and <code>matplotlib</code> to make a basic graph of a fern. This is inspired from an introductory computational mathematics course that I'm currently taking in which we did the same task using <code>MATLAB</code>. Personally, I find <code>MATLAB</code> to be less satisfying than <code>Python</code>, so I thought it pleasant to make a quick translation. 

The basic idea is to plot a few thousand points by generated by a few basic transformations. Each transformation is created using a given probability. Pretty basic, but an interesting exercise none-the-less. One nice thing about using <code>Numpy</code> is that it has built-in <code>MATLAB</code> matrix notation using <i>mat</i> rather than forcing us to use the default <i>array</i>. As always, code can be found at the end of the post.

    if r < 0.01:
        z = mat("0 0; 0 0.16")*z
    elif 0.01 <= r and r < 0.86:
        z = mat("0.85 0.04; -0.04 0.85")*z + mat("0; 1.6")
    elif 0.86 <= r and r < 0.93:
        z = mat("0.2 -0.26; 0.23 0.22")*z + mat("0; 1.6")
    else:
        z = mat("-0.15 0.28; 0.26 0.24")*z + mat("0; 0.44")
    plt.plot(z[0], z[1], 'r.', markersize=1)
    plt.hold(True) 
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
