What is it to interpret an age? If metaphysics grounds an age, as MH asserts, then it is to reflect on _what is_ and _what concept of truth_ that serves as its basis. An interpretation of our own age requires asking the essential difference between our age and the past, to which we answer among the lines of general human emancipation, the of freeing man to himself, the seeing man as individual subject (e.g. an abhorrence of slavery).

Heidegger says this is a correct but superficial description:

> Certainly the modern age has, as a consequence of the liberation of
> man, introduced subjectivism and individualism. But it remains just as
> certain that no age before this one has produced a comparable
> objectivism [towards nature/history via modern science] and that in no
> age before this has the non-individual, in the form of the collective,
> come to acceptance as having worth [e.g. corporations]."

What, then, is superficial? For MH, our age has seen the consummation of both subjectivity and objectivity--perhaps similarly of freedom and bondage. To understand superficially is to fail to understand essentially. What is essential of the modern age is not mere subjectivitsm and freedom, but their respective interplay between objectivism and bondage.

Indeed freedom/bondage seems to play the same game as subjectivity/objectivity in modernity, allowing us to ask with all generality "has there ever been a age of man so free?
