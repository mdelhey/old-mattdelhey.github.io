		Spinoza's Proposition 13 asserts that the object of the idea constituting the human mind is indeed nothing but an existing body. In this paper I first observe that Spinoza's argument for Pr.13 is two-fold, each in the form of proof by contradiction. I offer a basic (i.e. naive) reconstruction of the argument and raise two objections, which I find fatal to the demonstration as reconstructed. Finally, I offer a second reconstruction that (1) mediates my objections by means of (2) better capturing Spinoza's implicit assumptions in the demonstration.

		<blockquote style="font-style:normal">
		In Propositions 22-23 of Ethics V, Spinoza turns his discussion to the eternality of the essence of body and the human mind. The full statement of the doctrine is Proposition 23: the human mind cannot be absolutely destroyed along with the body, but something of it remains and is eternal. This doctrine has important implications for Spinoza’s moral philosophy as well as his metaphysics and has thus been the focus of much scholarly attention. In this paper, I first put Spinoza’s argument on the table with a basic reconstruction. I then consider both Curley’s and Bennett’s interpretation of the argument and its relevant premises. I agree with Bennett in his objection to what he calls Curley’s symmetrical account, but aim to avoid Bennett’s conclusion that Spinoza’s argument is altogether wrong by exploring the possibility of a new interpretation of the relevant premises.
