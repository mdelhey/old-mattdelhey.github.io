With all the hype surrounding garage rock nowadays you’d think you’d hear more about The Cramps (edit: maybe you do). This five track debut EP is a great introduction, highlighting the band’s strange lyrical style and aggressiveness. Alex Chilton (of Big Star fame) does wonders with the production, giving the guitars their bright, rockabilly sound. Those new to The Cramps will enjoy the single-worthy tracks “Human Fly” and “The Way I Walk” and fans can still grab this release for the bombastic “Surfin’ Bird” cover (proto-proto punk??)
