A debut live album has never been so appropriate. The Motor City 5 make themselves entirely clear: you’re either with them, or against them. And from the instant Rob Tyner ends his call to arms to the audience, you’re bombarded with some of my favorite Rock N’ Roll this side of the Atlantic. Taking The Stooges to their populist extension, MC5 show the world what an electric guitar and a no-fucks-given attitude can entail, 7 years before 1976. Kick out the jams motherfuckers.
