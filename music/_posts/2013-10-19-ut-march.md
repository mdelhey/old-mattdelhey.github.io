Not as much to say about this one. A collection of folk covers, instrumentals, and acoustic songs. I suppose you either get it or you move on. It's eerie to see eye to eye with an album in this way, but I guess that's why we play the music game in the first place.

Favorite tracks: Take My Word / Lilli Schull
