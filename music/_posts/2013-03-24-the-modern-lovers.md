Punk for lovers, if you want to put it that way. Or just a continuation of VU (produced by J. Cale nonetheless). For all their pop intentions The Modern Lovers never received due attention and are continuously looked over by otherwise well-listened hipsters of our day. This is the band’s one & only LP and points to the direction punk could have gone. Richman’s vocal delivery style is laid back and heartfelt (cmon, he just want’s a girl he cares about...) which is supported with distorted guitars that I swear are sampled from White Light/White Heat. Classic tracks include Roadrunner / Pablo Picasso / Girlfriend / I’m Straight. Pablo Picasso never got called an asshole...
