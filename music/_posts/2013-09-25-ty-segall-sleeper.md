![ty segall - sleeper]({{ site.url }}/images/albums/sleeper.jpg)

Yet another Ty Segall album. But this one's a bit different, composed mostly of acoustic guitars and Ty's vocals (sorry fuzz lovers). Overall it's pretty good. This is a slightly more mature TS and it's nice to see him make a song that sounds at least somewhat different than all of his other songs. Tracks "Sleeper" and "The Keepers" are catchy as hell, "Sweet C.C." is just great, and "The West" sounds like a Ty Segall take on Woody Guthrie to an enjoyable result.
