You probably don’t listen to much ‘post-hardcore’—at least I don’t. But Fugazi rock’s, man. This debut EP is a killer, delivering ridiculously memorable punk riffs on nearly every track. Vocal style is somewhere between Paul Westerberg and Blink 182, which actually works in practice. Fugazi tows the perfect line between indie rock and punk in this release, each song seemingly more like a perfect Pixies b-side than the last (or maybe the Pixies wished they sounded like Fugazi??). “Badmouth” is as good as anything hitting the alternative airwaves at the time and “Give Me The Cure” seems to have perfected Spiderland three years before it’s own release...
