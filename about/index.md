Hi, my name is Matt Delhey (shocker, I know). I'm a student at Rice University studying statistics and philosophy. I do data science and write about it, among other things. 

I can be hailed at [matt.delhey@rice.edu](mailto:matt.delhey@rice.edu).

### About that tagline... ###
It's supposed to be a joke. It comes from the first lines of Kierkegaard's 'The Sickness Unto Death':

> Man is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? 
> The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation 
> [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self;
> the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to
> its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the
> eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors.
> So regarded, man is not yet a self.

I take it that Kierkegaard is poking fun at that kind of obtuse Hegelian language often associated with academic philosophy. But at the same time S.K. is making an important point regarding the despairing difference between man and himself. 

### Music ###

Outside of school my biggest hobby is music. I'm an avid CD and Vinyl collector as well as a DJ at KTRU, the on-campus radio station here at Rice. I think live shows are overrated. Currently, I'm trying to learn guitar and harmonica. I listen to a lot of music: [RateYourMusic](http://rateyourmusic.com/~apy) or [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/mattdelhey).


### Philosophy ###

My study of philosophy is epiphenomenal to my interest in data science, like a hobby you can take classes in. I study philosophy for its own sake (whatever that may be...) and do not see it pragmatic. I definitely plan on writing some philosophy blog posts but I'm not sure which direction I'm going to take them. I'm a big fan of [Philosophy Bites](http://www.philosophybites.com/), so I hope to make some responses to their interviews.
